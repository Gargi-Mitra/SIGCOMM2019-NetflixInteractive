# SIGCOMM2019-NetflixInteractive
This dataset contains the anonymized encrypted network traces of interactive videos on Netflix corresponding to viewing sessions of 100 viewers. The network traces were collected from the nearest gateway. The ground truth for evaluation was generated by asking the viewers to note down the choices they made. The viewers were free to choose the device, operating system, browser, and the geographic location from which they could watch the movie. We also collected some behavioral parameters of the viewers to highlight the implications of the privacy leak discussed in the paper titled "White Mirror: Leaking Sensitive Information from Interactive Netflix Movies using Encrypted Traffic Analysis", published in ACM SIGCOMM 2019.

The dataset is undergoing sanity check and anonymization. It will be available here on and from September 7, 2019
